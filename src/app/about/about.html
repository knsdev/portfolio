        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <h3>a bit about me:</h3>
        <p>
          I&lsquo;m a passionate software developer with 7 years of experience in game development, now focused on web
          development. I&lsquo;ve completed a Full Stack Web Developer course at CodeFactory, where I deepened my skills
          in modern
          web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a career rooted entirely in software development, I&lsquo;m driven by a strong interest in technology,
          creativity,
          and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building engaging digital products and am now actively seeking a role in web developmentâ€”frontend,
          backend, or
          full stack.
