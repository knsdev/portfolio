        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <h3>a bit about me:</h3>
        <p>
          I&lsquo;m a passionate software developer with 7 years of experience in game development, now shifting my
          focus to web
          development. Currently, I&lsquo;m enhancing my skills through a Full Stack Web Developer course at
          CodeFactory.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a career rooted entirely in software development, I&lsquo;m driven by a strong interest in technology,
          creativity,
          and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building engaging digital products and look forward to applying my experience in a web development
          roleâ€”frontend, backend, or full stack.
